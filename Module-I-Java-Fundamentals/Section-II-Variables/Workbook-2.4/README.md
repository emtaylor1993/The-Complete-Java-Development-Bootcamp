When it comes to $24000, we don't care about cents. Print each value as a whole number (24309), not a decimal (24309.65).

## Task 2: Run Your Code
- This month, we made $24309 in sales
- Factoring in costs, we made $18562 in profit
- The refunds are at a low $688. This is a good sign!
- Shipping costs were high. We paid $1233 in shipping
