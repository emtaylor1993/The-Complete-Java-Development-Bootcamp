# Pokerito
Pokerito is like Poker, but the rules are a lot simpler. The dealer will give you one card and the computer one card.
Then the dealer will draw five cards (the river). The player with the most river matches wins. If the matches are equal, everyone's a winner!

## Task 1: Create randomCard() Function.
Create a function that returns a card from 1 - 13.
