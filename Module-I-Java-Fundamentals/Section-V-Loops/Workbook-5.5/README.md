# Workbook 5.5 - Counter Tool Revisited

- The steps to count by
- The number to count from
- The number to count to

Your program will coutn frmo the second number to the third number, in steps of the first.

## Task 1: Get Integers from User
You'll ask the user three questions:
- Pick a number to count by: 
- Pick a number to start counting from:
- Pick a number to count to:
  
The user will submit his answers <b>BESIDE</b> each question

## Task 2: Write Loop
Make a for loop that:
