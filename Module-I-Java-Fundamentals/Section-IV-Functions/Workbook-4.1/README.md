He needs to write this paragraph 6 times:
I will not copy and paste code.
I will not use Camel Case when writing class names.
I will user lower Camel Case when writing function names.
I will use lower Camel Case when writing variable names.

Bart wrote the paragraph once, but it took him a long time!

## Task 1: Write Function
Help Bart write a function that does the task for him. The doc comment will guide you.

## Task 2: Call Function
Once you finish writing it, call the function six times from main().
