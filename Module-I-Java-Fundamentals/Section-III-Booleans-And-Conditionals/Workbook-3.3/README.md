# Workbook 3.3 - The Quidditch Championship
This is a modified passage from the book: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

"If Gryffindor beats Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points,
they would win the championship. If they win by any number of points
or tie, they would come second. If they lose by less than a
hundred points, they come third behind Hufflepuff. If they lose by
more than a hundred points, they would be in fourth place"

We're going to convert this passage into code. The code srats with the number of points scored by Gryffindor and Ravenclaw.
