# Workbook 3.5 - Your Work Schedule
Assume that day can be any value between 1 (Monday) and 7 (Sunday). There's also a boolean variable: holiday.

## Task 1: Do I Have Work That Day?
If it's a holiday, print:
- Woohoo, no work!
If it's the weekend (Saturday or Sunday), print:
- It's the weekend, no work!
Otherwise, print:
- Wake up at 7:00 :(
