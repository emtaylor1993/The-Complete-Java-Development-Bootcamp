# Workbook 6.3 - Java Grocer
In this workbook, you found work at the Java Grocer. Your job is to help customers find what they're looking for.

## Task 1
The store has six aisles: apples, bananas, candy, chocolate, coffee, and tea. Create an array that stores each aisle. Then, print the contents of the array using a for loop. Once that works, keep the for loop but remove the println statement.

## Task 2
A customer came in and they're wondering where the coffee is. Use the for loop from task 1 to search through the array. If the element says: <i>coffee</i>, break the loop and print: We have that in aisle: index.
