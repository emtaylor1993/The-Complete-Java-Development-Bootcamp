# Workbook 6.4 - Java Grocer (Revisited)
Another day, another shift at the Java Grocer.

## Task 1
The workbook starts by asking the user: Welcome to Java Grocers. What can I help you find? Set up Scanner, and pick up the user's response.

## Task 2
Using the for loop, check every element in the array. If there's a match, break the loop and print the aisle (index) that they're looking for.
