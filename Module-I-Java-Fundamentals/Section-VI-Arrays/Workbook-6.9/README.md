# Workbook 6.9 - Taxes
Timmy went to the Java Grocer and bought four items at these prices: 1.99, 2.99, 3.99, 4.99. He would like to know what the prices are after-tax. Since you're the Java Grocer's best cashier, they want you to build a program that updates the prices after-tax.

## Task 1
Inside main, an array stores each price. Create a new array afterTax with the same length.

## Task 2
In the Java world, the tax rate is 13%. Use a for loop to update each element in afterTax to be: price + 13% * price.

## Task 3
Pring the following messages:
- The original prices are: [original prices]
- The prices after tax are: [after tax prices]

Use Arrays.toString to print the arrays.
