# Hangman
Hangman is a word-guessing game. It keeps asking the user to guess characters until:
1. They guess every character correctly (win).
2. They miss 6 guesses (loss).

## Task 1:
In the starter project, I left you an array of words. Your game must choose a random word frmo this list of words. The placeholders in your game must reflect the number of characters in that word.

## Task 2:
At every turn, you need to show the gallows. In your starter project, you'll find an array: Each String in the array reflects the number of times the user guessed incorrectly. You need to show the gallows at every turn. This should be your output when the user misses two guesses.

## Task 3: 
You need to keep track of every incorrect guess the user made. This helps the user not make the same mistake twice.

## Task 4:
When the user guesses correctly, replace the matching placeholders.

## Task 5:
If the user wins, stop the game. Example of a winning game:

If the user loses, stop the game. Example of a losing game:
